# About
I am a 4th  semester student of **Computer Science and Information Systems** at the Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science at the Warsaw University of Technology.

I have a strong command of Java, as it is the language I have programmed in the longest. I also have a good grasp of C, C++, C#, Python. I look forward to learning Kotlin.

In my free time I would like to resume working on my [Java game engine](https://github.com/kubazuch/KuZuEngine-old), which I've written for the sole purpose of learning.
