# About
I am a 1st semester Masterâ€™s student of **Computer Science and Information Systems**, specializing in **CAD/CAM Systems Design**, at the Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science at the Warsaw University of Technology.

I have a strong command of Java and C++, as those are the languages I have programmed in the most. I also have a good grasp of C, C#, Python. I look forward to learning Kotlin.

In my free time I like to work on my [C++ game engine](https://github.com/kubazuch/kEn), which I've been writing for the sole purpose of learning.
